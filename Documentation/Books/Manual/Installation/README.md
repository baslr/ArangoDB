Installation
============

First of all, download and install the corresponding RPM or Debian package or use
_homebrew_ on MacOS X. You can find packages for various operating systems at our
[install](https://www.arangodb.com/download) section, including installers
for Windows.

How to do that in detail is described in the subsections of this Chapter.

For detailed information on how to deploy ArangoDB, please refer to the
[Deployment](../Deployment/README.md) chapter.
